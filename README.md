# Census geographies no water single part:
takes Census polygons, removes water and makes each polygon single part to improve other subsequent analyses. Rows for each polygon have the the Census GEOID, the state (two-letter code), county (as text), the area of the total geography (its former multi-part polygon, if applicable), the area of the single-part polygon, and the proportion of the multi-part that each single part makes up. The intention is that tabular data can be joined via the GEOID and re-weighted by the proportion. This essentially reallocates census data proportional to the area of the polygon in multipart cases. The underlying assumption is a homogenously distributed population within a geography, which is known to be false.
